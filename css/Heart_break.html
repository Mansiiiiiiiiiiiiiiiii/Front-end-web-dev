    <h1>Heart break infinte time</h1>
    <p class="paraClass">Go back and check all of your past conversations. Was it always him who started the conversation? Was it always him asking you questions and you barely asking anything about him?

        It's great to receive attention from the one you like. But you have to give it back. Nobody wants to feel like they're the only one who cares in a relationship, so this could be the reason he decided to stop making an effort.</p>
<h2>1. He’s testing you</h2>
<p class="paraClass" >He’s checking to see whether you like him as much as he likes you, or he’s checking to see whether his flirty routine has been working or not. He could leave it quiet for a few days, then start with the constant texting again. If you don’t reply, he’ll assume you’re not interested.

    Most guys don’t like it when someone they’ve been texting suddenly stops texting back, just as much as you don’t. But, in some ways, it’s a game for him.
    
    This guy will stop texting first for a while. Now, you’ll have to text first. He’ll probably be quite normal *or even warm and affectionate* when he replies. But he’s not lavishing you with the attention you got used to before.</p>
    <h2>2. He’s love-bombing you
    </h2>
    <p class="paraClass">
        While love-bombing is very common, it’s not always harmless. He’s trying to power play by love-bombing you. He wants you to be the one waiting for him to text, to be hanging off his every word. That’s not where you should be, and certainly not what a relationship is about.

        When a guy starts off strong and consistent and then stops texting you every day, you’ll fall right into his trap and start sending texts first and more often

    </p>
    <h2>3. He’s not interested anymore</h2>
    <p class="paraClass" >“But he was obsessed with me before?”
        Well, this is because for some people, the more they get to know someone, the less they’re interested
        Why? Because when you first meet someone, it’s their looks that draw you in. Then how your relationship develops depends on whether you two are compatible with one another.

Don’t take this to heart. One guy not being interested in you doesn’t change the fact that you’re still an amazing person. There are plenty of fish in the sea, so you’ll find the perfect one eventually

    </p>
    <h2>4. He’s found someone else</h2>
    <p class="paraClass">
        You might think you know everything about the guy from texting him every day, but this isn’t true. You’re not in a relationship yet, and there are almost always things that he hasn’t told you.

In this modern world, dating apps exist. So he may be talking to ten people at the same time while he’s your only one. The conversations you have with him might be special to you, but maybe it’s ordinary to him. He might even be saying the same things to other women!

So when he’s found another girl he likes better than the rest, there’s a very good chance the guy will suddenly stop texting you or worse, even ghost you.
    </p>
    <h2>5.He finds you clingy</h2>
    <p class="paraClass" >Don’t be offended. We’re all clingy to at least one person. It doesn’t always mean that you’re the problem. It’s just because you may be high maintenance, and he’s not.

        People have different love languages, and yours just happen to be reassurance and words of affection. He might try to live up to your expectations of him initially, but then he may find it exhausting and eventually stop.</p>
        <h2>6. Hemis afraid of commitment</h2>
        <p class="paraClass">Okay, so maybe he really does like you, but he decides to stop texting you anyway because he’s scared. Guys can have feelings for a girl and not want to commit. It’s just how they are.

        </p>
        <h2>7. You’ve had a text misunderstanding
        </h2>
        <p class="paraClass" >You’ve had a text misunderstanding
            Maybe you made a joke and he’s not sure what it meant exactly. Or maybe you’re naturally sarcastic, but he thinks you’re being serious.

            It’s texting. You don’t see each other’s faces when you’re speaking. So, this mix-up can easily happen. Make sure you make it somewhat obvious what you’re trying to say.</p>
            <h2>8. You text him too much</h2>
            <p class="paraClass">In other words, he’s bored. You text him all the time and it’s killed the mystery and chase that he’s looking for.

                Plus, what can you possibly talk about via text all day long? Exactly. The conversations are getting boring, so he decided to put you on a time out for a couple of days.</p>
<h1>What to do when a guy stops texting you</h1>
<h2>1) Reach out, but only once</h2>
<p class="paraClass">I’ve seen some advice that says never reach out to a man. I think that is nonsense.

    After all, it totally depends on the relationship you have with him and the situation. I don’t believe there is anything wrong with sending one message to try to get to the bottom of things.
    
    It’s up to you what feels most appropriate. It could be something casual, just to test the water and see if you get a response. Something like:
    
    “Hey, haven’t heard from you in a while, all ok?”
    
    Or if there is zero doubt in your mind that he has stopped talking to you, then you may decide to address the elephant in the room directly with something like:
    
    “What happened?”
    
    You aren’t losing any self-respect or dignity in checking in on someone who you genuinely like. It simply shows good communication and maturity if anything.
    
    But don’t let this spill over into desperate behavior. So this part’s important:</p>

<h2>2) Do not chase him</h2>
<p class="paraClass">The point above leads me very nicely to my next point.

    After sending your one message, do nothing. Nada.
    
    The ball is now in his court. You have to wait for him to contact you.
    
    I know this may seem torturous, but even if you don’t hear from him, then you do (in a roundabout way) have your answer.</p>
    <h2>3) Do not social media stalk him</h2>
    <p class="paraClass">Still watching what he is up to on social media is like picking an open wound and then wondering why it hurts.

        My friend tortured herself about a guy who she liked that stopped talking to her, yet he still followed her on social media and watched all her stories.
        
        She found it super confusing. But the truth is actually pretty simple:
        
        He is happy to be an observer in your life but doesn’t care enough to be a participator.
        
        To avoid this, ban yourself from checking his social media (but that requires willpower), mute him or unfollow him</p>
        <h2>4) Lean on fun distractions</h2>
        <p class="paraClass">A watched phone never pings.

            The best antidote to problems in our love life can be to bring the focus back on ourselves to quit obsessing about them.
            
            Try to have fun, see friends, watch comedies, do your favorite hobbies, and take care of yourself.
            
            Your world is way bigger than this one guy, so be sure to remind yourself of that.</p>
            <h2>5) Move on</h2>
            <p class="paraClass">If you’ve still not heard from a guy who stopped talking to you, then rest assured there are plenty of fish in the sea.

                Why does it hurt when someone stops talking to you? Because all rejection hurts, and we see it as a form of rejection.
                
                But the brutal truth is that if he’s stopped talking to you, then he is far from your Prince Charming.
                Sadly he has shown you that he isn’t worth your time and energy.

And as Maya Angelou once said, “When people show you who they are, believe them the first time.”
