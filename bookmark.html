A bookmark is a thin marking tool, commonly made of card, leather, or fabric, used to keep
 track of a reader's progress in a book and allow the reader to easily return to where the 
previous reading session ended. Alternate materials for bookmarks are paper, metals like <br>
silver and brass, silk, wood, cord (sewing), and plastic. Some books may have one or more <br>
bookmarks made of woven ribbon sewn into the binding. Furthermore, other bookmarks <br>
 incorporate a page-flap that enables them to be clipped on a page.

           History 
        </h1>
        <p>
According to new results of the research done on the history of bookmarks, there are <br>
 indications that bookmarks have accompanied codices since their first emergence in the <br>
1st century AD.[1] The earliest existing bookmark dates from the 6th century AD and it is <br>
made of ornamented leather lined with vellum on the back and was attached with a leather <br>
strap to the cover of a Coptic codex (Codex A, MS 813 Chester Beatty Library, Dublin). <br>
It was found near Sakkara, Egypt, under the ruins of the monastery Apa Jeremiah. Further <br>
earliest bookmarks and remnants of them have been found in Coptic codices dating from the <br>
1st to the 11th century and in Carolingian codices from the 8th to the 12th century. <br>
Bookmarks were used throughout the medieval period,consisting usually of a small parchment <br>
 <br>
 strip attached to the edge of folio (or a piece of cord attached to headband).

Modern bookmarks are available in a huge variety of materials in a multitude of designs <br>
 and styles. Many are made of cardboard or heavy paper, but they are also constructed of <br>
paper, ribbon, fabric, felt, steel, wire, tin, beads, wood, plastic, vinyl, silver, gold, <br>
and other precious metals, some decorated with gemstones.

The first detached, and therefore collectible, bookmarkers began to appear in the 1850s. <br>
One of the first references to these is found in Mary Russell Mitford's Recollections of a <br>
Literary Life (1852): "I had no marker and the richly bound volume closed as if <br>
instinctively." Note the abbreviation of 'bookmarker' to 'marker'. The modern abbreviation <br>
is usually 'bookmark'. Historical bookmarks can be very valuable, and are sometimes <br>
collected along with other paper ephemera.

By the 1860s, attractive machine-woven markers were being manufactured, mainly in Coventry,
 <br>
England, the centre of the silk-ribbon industry. One of the earliest was produced by J.&J.
 <br>
Cash to mark the death of Albert, Prince Consort, in 1861. Thomas Stevens of Coventry soon <br>
became pre-eminent in the field and claimed to have nine hundred different designs.

Woven pictorial bookmarks produced by Thomas Steven, a 19th-century English silk weaver, <br>
starting around 1862, are called Stevengraphs.[4] Woven silk bookmarks were very <br>
appreciated
gifts in the Victorian Era and Stevens seemed to make one for every occasion and <br>
 celebration. One Stevengraph read: All of the gifts which heaven bestows, there <br>
 is one above all measure, and that's a friend midst all our woes, a friend is a found <br> 
  treasure to thee I give that sacred name, for thou art such to me, and ever proudly <br>
  will I claim to be a friend to thee.

Most 19th-century bookmarks were intended for use in Bibles and prayer books and were <br>
made of ribbon, woven silk, or leather. By the 1880s the production of woven silk markers <br>
 was declining and printed markers made of stiff paper or cardboard began to appear in <br>
 significant numbers. This development paralleled the wider availability of books <br>
  themselves, and the range of available bookmarkers soon expanded dramatically.

        <p>Bookmarks that do not damage the books that they are used in should be acid-free, thin, so they will not indent the pages they rest between, and include no dyes or decorative materials that might bleed into the book's paper, with flat, thin, gentle edges.</p>
