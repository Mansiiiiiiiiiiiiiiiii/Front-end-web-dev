        <h1><strong>Jai Shree Ram</strong></h1>

        <p class="chup">Jai Shri Ram is an expression in Indic languages, translating as "Glory to Lord Rama" or "Victory to Lord Rama".
         The proclamation has been used by Hindus as a symbol of adhering to Hindu faith, or for projection of varied faith-centered
          emotions.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="chup">The expression was used by the Indian Hindu nationalist organisations Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
           and their allies, which embraced the slogan in the late 20th century as a tool for increasing the visibility of Hinduism in public 
           spaces, before going on to use it as a battle cry. The slogan has since been employed in connection with the perpetration of communal
            violence against people of other faiths.</p>

                You were presented with an immutable power when you joined this life. Somehow, you understand that is the thing that gives you 
            life and by that account alone, it is the most valuable thing in existence. Somehow you also realize that all joy and happiness
             comes from that power within you. It’s not until much later that you learn the word for it: “Love”.

                     after the first image of the new Ram Lalla idol became public on Friday as anticipation built up for the consecration ceremony at the Ayodhya
                      temple on January 22.Speaking on the Ram temple ceremony, Acharya Satyendra Das said, "…where the new idol is, the rituals
                       of prana pratishtha are being performed... The body of the idol has been covered with clothes for now... The idol that has
                        been revealed with open eyes is not correct... The eyes will not open before the pran pratishtha... If such an image is
                         appearing, an investigation should be conducted to determine who did it."

                      There have been concerns among officials after the photo of Ram Lalla was leaked from Shri Ram Janmabhoomi sanctum sanctorum
                       before the consecration of Ram temple. The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust is now seriously considering taking
                        action against the culprits for leaking the photo of Ram Lalla.The trust suspects that the photo of Ram Lalla that has
                         gone viral on social media has been done by officials engaged in construction work at the temple site. The trust is
                          preparing to take action against the officers who made Ramlala's photo viral.

                        An image of the Ram Lalla idol, carved in black stone sourced from Karnataka, with its eyes uncovered had gone viral on
                         social media on Friday. In the photo, the idol is adorned with a garland of roses, going by the picture released by the
                          Vishva Hindu Parishad. Ram Lalla, the child Ram, is in the standing posture.
                        
                        The new 51-inch idol, carved by sculptor Arun Yogiraj of Mysuru, was placed in the sanctum sanctorum of the Ram 
                        Janmabhoomi temple on Thursday afternoon, brought there on a truck on Wednesday night.
