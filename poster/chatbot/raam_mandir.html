            The Ram Mandir is a Hindu temple under construction in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, India. It is located at the site of Ram Janmabhoomi.
            The site is the former location of the Babri Masjid which was built in 16th century CE after the demolition of an existing non-Islamic
             structure. The idols of Rama and Sita were placed in the mosque in 1949, before it was attacked and demolished in 1992. In 2019, 
             the Supreme Court of India delivered the verdict to give the disputed land to Hindus for construction of a temple, while Muslims 
             would be given land elsewhere to construct a mosque. The court referenced a report from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI)
              as evidence suggesting the presence of a structure beneath the demolished Babri Masjid, that was found to be non-Islamic.However,
               ASI claims were heavily disputed by critics as contradictory, dubious, and being the product of nationalistic manipulation.
               <br>
               The bhumi pujan (transl. ground breaking ceremony) for the commencement of the construction of Ram Mandir was performed on
                5 August 2020, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.[18] The temple, currently under construction, is being supervised by the Shri Ram 
                Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust. The inauguration of the temple is scheduled for 22 January 2024.
                <br>
                The temple has attracted a number of controversies due to alleged misuse of donation, sidelining of its major activists and politicisation of
                 the temple by the BJP

        <h1><strong>History</strong></h1>
        <h3><strong>Ancient and Medieval</strong></h3>
        <p class="heart_break">
Ram an incarnation of Vishnu, is a Hindu deity. According to the ancient Indian epic, Ramayana, Rama was born in Ayodhya.
<br>
In the 16th century, the temple was attacked and destroyed by Babur in his series of temple raids across northern India.
 Later, the Mughals constructed a mosque, the Babri Masjid, which is believed to be the site of the Ram Janmabhoomi, the birthplace of Rama.
The earliest record of the mosque may be traced back to 1767, in the Latin book Descriptio Indiae, authored by the Jesuit missionary Joseph 
Tiefenthaler. According to him, the mosque was constructed by destroying the Ramkot temple, believed to be the fortress of Rama in Ayodhya, and
 the Bedi, where the birthplace of Rama is situated.

 <br>
 The first instance of religious violence was documented in 1853. In December 1858, the British administration prohibited Hindus from
  conducting puja (rituals) at the contested site. A platform was created for conducting rituals outside the mosque.
  <br>
  <h3>Mordern</h3>
  <p class="heart_break">
    The murtis of Rama and Sita were installed inside the Babri Masjid on the night of 22–23 December 1949 and the devotees began to 
  gather from the next day.By 1950, the state took control of the mosque under section 145 CrPC and allowed Hindus, not Muslims, to
   perform their worship at the site
  <br>
  In the 1980s, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), belonging to the Hindu nationalist family, Sangh Parivar, launched a new movement to reclaim the 
  site for Hindus and to erect a temple dedicated to the infant Rama (Ram Lalla) at this spot. The VHP began to collect funds and bricks with 
  "Jai Shri Ram" written on them. Later, the government under Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi gave the VHP permission for Shilanyas
 to proceed, with the then Home Minister, Buta Singh, formally conveying the permission to the VHP leader, Ashok Singhal.

    The demolition of the mosque resulted in several months of inter-communal violence between India's Hindu and Muslim communities,
     causing the death of an estimated 2,000 people in Bombay (now Mumbai) as a direct consequence, and triggering riots all over the
      Indian subcontinent. A day after the demolition of the mosque, on 7 December 1992, The New York Times reported that over 30 Hindu
       temples across Pakistan were attacked, some set on fire, and one was demolished. Hindu temples in Bangladesh were also attacked.
       On 5 July 2005, five terrorists attacked the makeshift Ram temple at the site of the destroyed Babri Masjid in Ayodhya. All five were 
       shot dead in the ensuing encounter with the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), while one civilian died in the grenade attack that
        the attackers launched to breach the cordoned wall. The CRPF suffered three casualties, two of whom were seriously injured with
         multiple gunshot wounds
