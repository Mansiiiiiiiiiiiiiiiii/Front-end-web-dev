            <h1><strong>Self-Esteem</strong></h1>
            <p>Low self-esteem refers to a person having an overall poor sense of self-value. It essentially means having a poor opinion of
                 yourself. Low self-esteem can encompass a range of factors, such as your sense of identity, self-confidence, feelings of
                  competence, and feelings of belonging.
                <br>
                Having self-esteem not only impacts how you feel about and treat yourself, but it can even affect your motivation to go 
                after the things you want in life and your ability to develop healthy, supportive relationships.
                </p>
            <p>Self-esteem is about more than just generally liking yourself—it also means believing that you deserve love and valuing your own 
                thoughts, feelings, opinions, interests, and goals. It can also play a role in how you allow others to treat you.
            <br>
            <strong>Having low self-esteem means that you often think negatively about yourself, judge yourself badly, and lack confidence in your abilities.</strong>
            </p>
            <p> <strong>You Can't Please Everyone</strong></p>
            <p>“I don’t know the secret to success, but the secret to failure is trying to please everyone” – Bill Cosby.You don’t need everyone 
                to agree with you or even like you. It’s human nature to want to belong, to be liked, respected and valued, but not at the expense
                 of your integrity and happiness. Other people cannot give you the validation you seek. That has to come from inside.</p>
                 <p>
                    <strong>Your Health Is Your Most Valuable Asset</strong>
                    Health is an invaluable treasure—always appreciate, nurture, and protect it. Good health is often wasted on the young before 
                    they have a chance to appreciate it for what it’s worth.

We tend to take our good health for granted, because it’s just there. We don’t have to worry about it, so we don’t really pay attention to it
 until we have to.
